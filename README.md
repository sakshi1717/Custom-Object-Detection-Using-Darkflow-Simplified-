# Custom-Object-Detection-Using-Darkflow-Simplified
This is a very simplified repository for custom object detection .If you want to just apply custom object detection using YOLO this is the best that you can get .It requires no prior Knowledge. So gear up and enjoy.

# Steps 
  - Setting up for installing tensorflow-gpu (if your GPU supports CUDA)
  - Image gathering 
  - Image annotation
  - Setting up environment
  - Setting up darkflow
  - File editing in Darkflow folder
  - Training
  - Predicting 
# Setting up for installing tensorflow-gpu (skip if you already have)
   
   This step is the most time taking step as during this step anyone can face lot of errors.So I will try my best to give you steps so that    you will not encounter any error.
   
   - First of all check your GPU is compatible with CUDA or not ?
   
     [CUDA comapatible GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
   - Then install anaconda cloud.  [from here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) 
     Note - while installing anaconda chwck "the anaconda add on my PATH variable"
